## Usage

Once installed, you will be able to send files across computers with the package and python on it OR
you can host a folder on network so anyone on network may download its contents.
If there is any problem you can file and issue on this repo.

### To listen for files

<br><img src="images/pdlisten.png" align="center"><br>

To send files, you will have to run the following command (The correct output is also shown): 

```
$ pdlisten

[SERVER]: Server is listening on 192.168.1.5:8080
[SERVER]: Connection Key: 192@168@1@58+8080
[SERVER]: Waiting for a connection for files...
```

To change the default port(8080), add the '-port XXXX' argument to the command and try again. 
If someone else conects using the pyserved 'pdsnd' command, enter the connection key which is showed. It will write the file to the current working directory

### To get files.

<br><img src="images/pdsnd.png" align="center"><br>

To send files, you will have to run the `pdsnd` command. It will prompt for the filepath of the file you want to send.
If everything goes right, the file will be sent to the person listening in the same network.
To change the default port(8080), add the '-port XXXX' argument to the command and try again.

```
$ pdsnd

[SERVER] : Program Initialized at current directory './'
[SERVER] : Connection Key: {Connection Key from pdlisten program}
[SERVER] : Filename: {Path of file which you want to transfer.}
```

### To host folder.

<br><img src="images/pdhost.png" align="center"><br>

To host a folder, you have to use the `pdhost` command. You can use the `-port` command so you may change the default port `6789`.
PS. Don't use in production environments! It only has basic security features!

```
$ pdhost -port 7070

[SERVER]: started at 192.168.1.58:7070
192.168.1.58 - - [22/Mar/2022 20:15:54] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
192.168.1.58 - - [22/Mar/2022 20:15:55] code 404, message File not found
192.168.1.58 - - [22/Mar/2022 20:15:55] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```
