[SERVER]: Waiting for a connection for files...

The pdlisten command included with PyServed Utilities is used
for hosting a PyServed file transfer server on your network.

The pdsnd command is used for sending a file to the server
created by the server.

### PDLISTEN ###

The pdlisten command when run gives a connection key which 
is needed to send a file while using pdsnd.

The -port argument may be used to change the port of the server.

Thanks for having interest in this library.
