The pdhost command included with PyServed Utilities is used
for hosting a folder on your network. The folder you host will be
accessible to anyone who has access to the network. You may change
the port by using the -port argument. The default port is 6789.
You will have to share the url shared at the fist line of the output.

Thanks for having interest in this library.
