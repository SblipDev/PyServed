[SERVER]: Server is listening on 192.168.1.58:8080
[SERVER]: Connection Key: 192@168@1@58+8080
[SERVER]: Waiting for a connection for files...

This program is used to listen for incoming connections from the 
pdsnd.py program. If it recieves a connection, it will write the
file in the directory. 

The pdsnd command is used for sending a file to the server
created by the server "pdlisten" program.

### PDLISTEN ###

The pdlisten command when run gives a connection key which 
is needed to send a file while using pdsnd.

The -port argument may be used to change the port of the server.

Thanks for having interest in this library.
This file is the script for the pdlisten program.
